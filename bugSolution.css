To fix this, we can increase the specificity of the selector to target only direct children of '.container'. We do this by using the direct child selector '>':

.container > .highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}

This ensures that only elements with the class 'highlight' that are immediate children of '.container' are styled, preventing unintended styling of nested elements.
